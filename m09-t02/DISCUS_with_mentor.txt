Mentor:  

- Are annotations better than XML for configuring Spring?

Mentee:

- The introduction of annotation-based configurations raised the question of whether this approach
is 'better' than XML. The short answer is it depends. The long answer is that each approach has
its pros and cons, and usually it is up to the developer to decide which strategy suits them better.
Due to the way they are defined, annotations provide a lot of context in their declaration, leading
to shorter and more concise configuration. However, XML excels at wiring up components without
touching their source code or recompiling them. Some developers prefer having the wiring close
to the source while others argue that annotated classes are no longer POJOs and, furthermore,
that the configuration becomes decentralized and harder to control.

- No matter the choice, Spring can accommodate both styles and even mix them together. Itâ€™s worth
pointing out that through its JavaConfig option, Spring allows annotations to be used in a non-
invasive way, without touching the target components source code and that in terms of tooling, all
configuration styles are supported by the Spring Tool Suite.
