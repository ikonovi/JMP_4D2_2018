## m01-t01:

### A bit of concurrency
Created several instances of Runnable interface with different behavior. 
Used lambda expressions. 
Run these lambdas via Thread API.
## m01-t02

### A person stream
Create:
1.	Person class with name and age fields
2.	A collection of Persons;
3.	Two instances of Comparator<Person> interface using lambda expressions: first one for comparing by name, second one â€“ by age

Then sort them using these comparators.
Use forEach method for printing information about all the persons. 
Try to use method reference if it is possible

# m01-t03

### Functional Interface Sandbox

1.	Implement each of main Java Standard Library functional interfaces (supplier, predicate etc.) using lambda expressions.
2.	Create your own functional interface and add several implementations using both lambda expressions and inner anonymous classes.
3.	Add few default methods to it and use them.
4.	Add few static methods to it and use them. 

# m01-t04

### Custom Functional Interface
1.	Write your own functional interface ThreeFunction (it takes three arguments and produce result).
2.	Implement this with two different lambdas
3.	Provide client code with usage of this lambdas
