### Move to Spring Boot 2.0

Take project from one of the solved tasks in Spring MVC or your small pet project on Spring MVC with the tiny domain model and a few JSP/HTML pages and simple routing and update it with the Spring Boot 2.0 using Spring MVC framework.

The application should contain:
1.	Logger
1.	Two profiles (“release” and “debug”)
1.	Error Handling with custom error pages
