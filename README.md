### Deadlocks

Create three threads:

*	1st thread is infinitely writing random number to the collection
*	2nd thread is printing sum of the numbers in the collection
*	3rd is printing square root of sum of squares of all numbers in the collection

Make these calculations thread-safe using synchronization block.
Fix the possible deadlock.
