### Create custom task
Write a custom task class of type Salary. Add a property ‘amount’ for the size of salary. Assign a default value to it. The task action should print the ‘amount’ value property. 

Add two tasks (MySalary and Mom's Friend's Son’s Salary) to your build script, both of type Salary. One should assign a custom value to the ‘amount’ property. Execute both tasks.
