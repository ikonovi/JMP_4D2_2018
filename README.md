2.	Inherit Cat and Dog from the Animal class.
3.	Compile the classes.
4.	Create your own ClassLoader by extension of the standard ClassLoader.
5.	Load the classes Cat and Dog into an array or collection Animals by your own class loader and run the methods "Play", "Voice".
6.	Output data to console by log4j library (logger).
Note: Methods should just print a text message.
